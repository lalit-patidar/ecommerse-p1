					<b>Always communicate on NichoShop</b>
				  </p>
				  <p>All communication between users must be carried on NichoShop, as emails are often important evidence in disputes between buyers and sellers, so it is extremely important that users communicate with each other only on NikoShop, so that users are </p></br>
				  
				  <p>
					<b>Always pay on NichoShop</b>
				  </p>
				  <p>Always pay for your purchases with a credit card at the NichoShop checkout, as this is one of the conditions to be protected by the NichoShop Buyer Protection policy. To qualify for NichoShop's Buyer Protection, you NEVER agree to pay outside of NichoShop.</p></br>	
				  
				  <p>
					<b>To prevent issues with the refund </b>
				  </p>
				  <p>Fraudsters impersonate buyers asking for refunds Ц always check Messages in My NichoShop to validate any request before refunding and always issue refunds through the appropriate NichoShop page. NEVER issue refunds outside of NichoShop.</p></br>	
				  
				  <p>
					<b>To protect you from fake emails for payment received </b>
				  </p>
				  <p>DonТt believe of fake emails for payment received and always confirm youТve received a payment before sending an item - check your order in Seller Central and ensure the status of the order is Awaiting dispatch.</p></br>	
				  
				  <p>
					<b>Tips for recognizing fake emails</b>
				  </p>
				  <p>Fake emails often include the NichoShop logo and a fake NichoShop address in the "From" line (for example, "From: NichoShop Customer Support"). Just because an email looks real doesn't mean it is. Here are some signs to watch out for:</p></br>	
                    <ul>
					  <li>Fake emails often ask you to reply to the message with confidential information. Know that NichoShop will never ask you to provide confidential information such as your password, credit card, or bank number in an email.</li>
					  <li>Fake emails often use urgent and threatening language and instruct you to update your NichoShop account information or risk your account suspension. Be aware that all important messages about your account will also be in the Messages tab in My NichoShop. NichoShop will never ask you to provide confidential information such as your password, credit card, or bank number in an email.</li>
					  <li>Fake emails might include attachments. Emails sent by NichoSop never include attachments. If you receive messages with attachments, do not open it, because quite often they contain malware.</li>
					  <li>Fake emails often have a generic greeting like "Attention NichoSop member." Be aware that NichoSop's emails always greet you by the first name you registered on your NichoSop account.</li>
                    </ul>
				  <p>To report a fake email that looks like it came from NichoShop, forward it as an attachment to <span style="color: #0072BC;">spoof@nichoshop.com.</span></p></br>	<button class="new_edit">Edit</button>
